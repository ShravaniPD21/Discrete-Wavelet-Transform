## 📝 Abstract
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a powerful signal and image processing technique that provides time–frequency representation of data. Unlike Fourier Transform, DWT analyzes signals at multiple resolutions, making it highly suitable for image compression, denoising, and feature extraction.

This project implements 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform on digital images using Python. The image is decomposed into approximation and detail sub-bands, visualized, and reconstructed using inverse DWT.
